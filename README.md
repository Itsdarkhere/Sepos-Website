# Hello friend!

## This is my very first full website project.
Created with React and Love.

The almost finished version is available for viewing at: https://sepos-515ff.web.app/

Still quite proud since I dont regard myself as a frontend developer and in my own opinion have been able to create a nice site for my client.

## The Project still needs a few small fixes, such as:

I might add some very small animations, or tweak existing ones, timing for one is a bit of rn with the preloader blocking.

Contacts still needs the real photos, might change the layout a little once I get them

Body-scroll-lock does not work on ios, need to change library or get a better understanding of the existing one.
