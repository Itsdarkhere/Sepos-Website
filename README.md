## Hello friend!

# This is my very first full website project.
Created with React and Love.

The almost finished version is available for viewing at: https://sepos-515ff.web.app/


#Â Still quite proud since I dont regard myself as a frontend developer and in my own opinion have been able to create a nice site for my client.

# The Project still needs a few small fixes, such as:

Work on element dimensions.

Body-scroll-lock is giving out a warning regarding ios devices, small patch has been made but I still need to check that it is properly working.

Need to optimise Image sizes with preloads and srcsets.

I need to check that the font sizes are still working in all sizes, since I just added a new font today.

Contact sections phone numbers are not great looking with the current font so I need to change that.

Garden projects 'big image' has a color variation that I need to work on.

Contacts section is still waiting for the real photos so I'm when I get them Ill work on adjusting the layout so that it does not screw up the images, like it currently does at some sizes.
